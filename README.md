# CustomerChurnRandomForest
A project to predict customer churn using the Random Forest algorithm, featuring data preprocessing, EDA, and model evaluation.


**Customer Churn Prediction Using Random Forest**  
This repository contains a project focused on predicting customer churn using the Random Forest algorithm. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and identify factors contributing to churn, enabling data-driven strategies to retain customers.

#### Features:
- **Dataset:** Includes preprocessing steps for cleaning and preparing the data.  
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Visualizations and insights derived from customer data.  
- **Model Implementation:** Random Forest classifier for predicting churn.  
- **Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model performance.  
- **Reproducibility:** Easy-to-follow code and explanations for replicating the results.

#### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/customer-churn-random-forest.git
   ```  
2. Install the required libraries (see `requirements.txt`).  
3. Run the `notebook.ipynb` file for step-by-step analysis and model training.
